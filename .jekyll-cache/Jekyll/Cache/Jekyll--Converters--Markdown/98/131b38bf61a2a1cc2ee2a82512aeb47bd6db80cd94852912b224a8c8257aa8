<h2 id="von-karman-effect">Von-Karman Effect</h2>
<p>In fluid dynamics, Von karman effect is a common vortex effect in which there is a repeating pattern of swirling vortices which are caused by the process called vortex shedding. These vortices are responsible for unsteady fluid flow separation around blunt bodies.</p>

<h2 id="calculation-of-the-reynolds-number">Calculation of the Reynolds Number</h2>

<p>\(Density ~ of~  air (\rho ) = 1.225 ~ kg/m^3\) 
\(\\ Kinematic ~ viscosity ~ of~  air (\mu)  = 1.4607^{-5} ~ m^2/s\)
\(\\ Characteristic ~ length  = L =Diameter ~ of ~ Cylinder  = 200 ~ mm\)
\(\\ Reynolds ~ Number  = Re = \frac{\rho \times V \times L}{\mu} \approx 16773 \times v\)</p>

<p>Here, The velocity used in the simulation was \(0.156 m/s\) which results in the Reynolds number \(\approx 2617\).</p>
