<p>I'm a Mechanical Design Engineer at Entegra Sources Pvt. Ltd., an outsourcing
    company that offers engineering services. I received my Bachelor
    in Mechanical Engineering
    in 2019 from <a href="https://pcampus.edu.np/" target="_blank">Pulchowk Campus, Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan
        University</a>. During my college, I did various kinds of real-life projects that honed me in learning different
    aspects of mechanical engineering. I performed a group project on fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) as a final
    year project.</p>
<p> Currently, I am actively looking for Phd Position in Mechanical Engineering. </p>
<p> I'm interested in research and development and passionate about mechanical engineering for the greater good of
    society. I'm experienced in CAD modelling and mechanical analysis and concerned with product design through both,
    Engineering and Reverse Engineering.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I like playing <a href="https://lichess.org/@/EngagedKnight" target="_blank"> chess</a>,
    reading, hiking and viewing nature.</p>
