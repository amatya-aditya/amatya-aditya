During this project, the fluid flow over cylinder was observed at different Reynolds number ranging from 5 to 3.5e6. The effect of Reynolds number was analysed and behavior of von karman street over different regimes was analysed.

## Von-Karman Effect
In fluid dynamics, Von karman effect is a common vortex effect in which there is a repeating pattern of swirling vortices which are caused by the process called vortex shedding. These vortices are responsible for unsteady fluid flow separation around blunt bodies.

## Calculation of the Reynolds Number

$$ Density ~ of~  air (\rho ) = 1.225 ~ kg/m^3 $$ 
$$ \\ Kinematic ~ viscosity ~ of~  air (\mu)  = 1.4607^{-5} ~ m^2/s$$
$$ \\ Characteristic ~ length  = L =Diameter ~ of ~ Cylinder  = 200 ~ mm$$
$$ \\ Reynolds ~ Number  = Re = \frac{\rho \times V \times L}{\mu} \approx 16773 \times v$$

Here, The velocity used in the simulation was $$ 0.156 m/s $$ which results in the Reynolds number $$\approx 2617$$.
